granblue bot semi-unattended

DON'T USE IT AS IS IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING OR YOU COULD GET BANNED! Since the game changes the verification and anti-bot measures every now and then you need to update the verification check.

This is a bot that was fully functional and unnatended for the browser game Granblue Fantasy. It uses a mix of image recognition and chromedriver automation, some features are not finished tho.

Some of the features are:
- quest spam (there's a list of the available ones in config.py like gw, angel halo, nm, mat quests, events...)
- complete combat routines for every difficult run(check char_templates.py)
- raid sniping via specific websites
- coop spam for slime with simple combat(works with a second account too, just needs to be started with a different chromedriver profile)
- poker is not yet implemented since I used my old autoit bot without any problem
- telegram integration to change settings, alert and send capchas, or simple error alerts(commands are outdated, check telegram_bot.py)

Disclaimer: This was developed long time ago and I didn't test it since I got banned, I published it for learning purposes alone.
